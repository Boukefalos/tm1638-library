= TM1638 library =

This is a library for interacting an arduino with a TM1638 module.

The [http://www.dealextreme.com/p/81873?r=68099021 TM1638 module] is a module with 8x 7-segment display (8 digits), 8x 2 color (red and green) LED and 8x buttons and is controlled using serial commands.

The TM1638 module is designed to be chainable. It uses only one pin for _clock_, one pin for _data_ and an additional pin (_strobe_) for each module you chain up to 6... that's a total of 8 pins for controlling 48 (8x6) 7-segment digits, 48 buttons and 96 LEDs (48 red and 48 green).

Great to use as a "helper/debugging" module.

= Usage =

This library is designed to allow usage of simultaneous independent modules (chained or unchained).

Basic usage is:
{{{
TM1638 module(8, 9, 7);
}}}

This defines a module with data on pin 8, clock on pin 9 and strobe on pin 7.

Chaining modules is as easy as:
{{{
TM1638 module1(8, 9, 7);
TM1638 module2(8, 9, 6);
}}}

This defines tow modules with data on pin 8, clock on pin 9 and strobes on pin 6 and 7.
